Found a name "BRAGI" its a Norse god of poetry and eloquence.

Now I just need to hack up a platform. 

I think it will work the same way as [[Markdown to HTML converter]] Sophistry. I will set up everything and make people run an executable. ~~I have to check how many pages I can post on Netlify.~~

I would need people to log in with Netlify so that's out of the question. I might try to have them send the files to my server and then upload them to Netlify for the CDN. But at that point its redundant. 

I found out every single CLI tool for pushing things to a static website host requires Node and it is making me depressed, I might have to create a full service for that too. For now I might try checking for the OS then installing Chocolatey or Homebrew and then installing Node from there.

Bun to the rescue, it has a curl command for mac on Linux and a PowerShell -c for windows, nice. Still using JS but at this point its ok. 

BUN DOES NOT WORK ON WINDOWS 

```
PS C:\Users\Windows 10> bun install --global surge

Panic: Windows support for bun install is not implemented yet

bun has crashed :'(

You can install PNPM with 

```
iwr https://get.pnpm.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

use it to install Surge but it still wont work without node...
Otherwise Surge is great.
