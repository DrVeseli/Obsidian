Found a name "BRAGI" its a Norse god of poetry and eloquence.

Now I just need to hack up a platform. 

I think it will work the same way as [[Markdown to HTML converter]] Sophistry. I will set up everything and make people run an executable. ~~I have to check how many pages I can post on Netlify.~~

I would need people to log in with Netlify so that's out of the question. I might try to have them send the files to my server and then upload them to Netlify for the CDN. But at that point its redundant.
