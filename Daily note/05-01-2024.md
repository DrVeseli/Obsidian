## Thinking about making a full blogging platform

Maybe a Obsidian add on can be made to automate what I already did with Netlify and [[Markdown to HTML converter]]

For some reason I made both the "normal" and light mode css files, full stylesheets instead of making a prim and sec color variable and switching them, I need to fix that today. 

Fixed it with

```
:root {

    --primary-color: #1a2733;

    --secondary-color: #ebe9e6;

    --accent-color: #3f4953;

  }
```

Now I have to fix the index page generator 

Everything seems to be fixed, the GO app is now running the netlify CLI commands.
