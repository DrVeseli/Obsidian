The blog site is technically working, I do need to find a way to automate posting.
Today I will finish styling, I don't know how long it will take because the [[Markdown to HTML converter]] handles formatting for the home page 

The Blog is up on [veskoart.net](veskoart.net) , I uploaded it manually to netlify. I need to figure out how to automate this.
