It is a new year and we are going to make progress everyday on Github

Turning the Netlify.com website into a personal blog powered by the obsidian vault and some shell scripts.
The stack: Markdown, Shell, CSS and HTML
Beyond the Header and Footer everything else will be written in Markdown and compiled into HTML. The home page will be just a list of articles ~~and the search bar will just be a hotkey for "cmd+f"~~ (this is imposible) there will be no search bar, if the user is dumb enough not to know how to ctrl+f there is no saving them

MANAGING STATE
	using URL parameters, even tho it might not work in a couple of years
