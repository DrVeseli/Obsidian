Took an easy 4 day break to fix the PC, I built it myself 2 years ago and it died every 3 months without missing a beat. The technician in a shop told me that if it was his he would separate all the parts and try to sell them because something must be cursed.

## On the topic of web development, twitter blessed me with a UI library
Its called [ShuelaceUI](https://shoelace.style/) and its a plug and play library with vanilla HTML and a CDN with a autoloader. Looking forward to making some HTMX websites based on GO.

I need to remake the [[Free Blog from Obsidian notes]]
I want to turn it into a Portfolio website, because there is 0 to NO chance I will ever make one, or keep it updated. First thing is to move daily notes from the first page, or at least collapse them. At least I need to make sure the file order is always the same so I can organise them

## Also also
There is news in the HTMX&GO community. A new Lib called [htmx-go](https://github.com/angelofallars/htmx-go) for setting up headers, works great and is small. Need to add it to [[Boilerplate Pocketbase-G + HTMX + Tmpl]]
