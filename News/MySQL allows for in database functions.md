On jan. 3. 2024. Oracle introduces JS support in MySQL. And even tho I believe separation of concerns to be a thing of the past, it is not true for the data base.

```
CREATE FUNCTION gcd_js (a INT, b INT) RETURNS INT 
LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT AS $$

  let [x, y] = [Math.abs(a), Math.abs(b)];
  while(y) [x, y] = [y, x % y];
  return x;

$$;
```

```
SELECT col1, col2, gcd_js(col1,col2)
FROM my_table
WHERE gcd_js(col1, col2) > 1
ORDER BY gcd_js(col1, col2);

CREATE TABLE gcd_tableÂ 
AS SELECT gcd_js(col1,col2)
FROM my_table;
```

There is a rightfully outdated practice called stored procedures that allowed for functions to be called during data storing. It was never great, and we moved beyond it. 

The reason for this attempted swing back started with GraphQL, also known as "no one wants to learn SQL" for some reason. Because you couldn't let anyone request anything from the data base you needed RLS, row level security, a micro process that determines if the client has privileges to access the data in the row. This is stupid, the client should not be able to access the database directly in any way shape or form.

You have the API and you have the server, they contact the data for the client!

Just for a secund imagine debugging your JS in your database

```
CREATE PROCEDURE division (IN a INT, IN b INT,
OUT result DOUBLE) LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT AS $$
  function validate(num) {
    console.log("validating input value: ", num);
    if (num === 0) throw ("Division by Zero!");
  }
  validate(b);
  result = a / b;
$$
```
# Why would MySQL do this?

Web dev has been moving serverless, people refuse to learn anything other then TypeScript, so why not? There are performance benefits when you run on the edge and your data is not on the same machine as the server, yes. You can do a lot less trips for the data if you do some calculations in the database. But working with something like this will be a nightmare, and the functions are written in JS which means there will be a lot of them, and most of them will be written poorly.

MySQL is not leading the charge in this, PVL8 for Postgre exist and is used, a lot. 

The V8 pandemic is in full swing and there seems to be nothing we can do to stop it.

Stay safe, use SQLite and compile your server to binary.
